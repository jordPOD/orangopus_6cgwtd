# Testing Slug-Based Routing

## Current Status

The application now has slug-based routing implemented, but the database migration for the slug column hasn't been run yet. Here's what's been implemented:

### âœ… What's Working

1. **Vue Router Setup**: The app now uses Vue Router with proper routes
2. **Project Detail Component**: A dedicated component for displaying individual projects
3. **Fallback Logic**: The system can handle both slug-based and ID-based URLs
4. **Navigation Updates**: All components now use router navigation instead of console.log

### ðŸ”§ What Needs to be Done

1. **Database Migration**: Run the slug migration to add the slug column
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Supabase credentials are properly configured

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Current Routing (ID-based)

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the projects section
3. Click on a project to view details
4. The URL should be `/project/{project-id}` (using the project's UUID)

### 2. Run Database Migration

To enable proper slug-based URLs:

1. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export VUE_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   export VUE_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

2. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   ./run-slug-migration.sh
   ```

3. After migration, URLs will be `/project/{slug}` instead of `/project/{id}`

### 3. Test Slug-Based Routing

1. Create a new project or update existing ones
2. The system will automatically generate slugs from project titles
3. URLs will be more user-friendly (e.g., `/project/my-awesome-project-12345678`)

## Troubleshooting

### "Project Not Found" Error

This usually means:
- The project doesn't exist in the database
- The slug column hasn't been added yet
- The project status is not 'published'

### "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned"

This means:
- The slug column doesn't exist yet (run the migration)
- Multiple projects have the same slug (shouldn't happen with unique index)
- No project matches the slug

## Next Steps

1. **Run the migration** to add slug support
2. **Test with real data** from your Supabase database
3. **Create some test projects** to verify slug generation
4. **Update any hardcoded links** to use the new routing system

## Migration Notes

The migration will:
- Add a `slug` column to the `projects` table
- Create a unique index on the slug column
- Generate slugs for existing projects
- Set up automatic slug generation for new projects
- Make the slug column required after migration
